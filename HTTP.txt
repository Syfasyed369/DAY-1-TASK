HTTP/1.1 vs. HTTP/2: A Quick Comparison
The web's backbone, HTTP, has evolved from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2,
and the differences are substantial.
Let's explore the key contrasts between the two:

HTTP/1.1: The Old Way
No Multiplexing: Each request blocks the next, causing delays.
Header Overhead: Headers add extra weight to requests.
Optional Compression: Not all clients and servers use compression.
No Prioritization: Resources aren't prioritized, leading to bottlenecks.

HTTP/2: The Modern Upgrade
Multiplexing: Simultaneous requests and responses for faster loading.
Efficient Header Compression: Reduces header overhead.
Prioritization: Critical resources are delivered first, improving speed.
Server Push: Resources are pushed to the client, reducing the need for extra requests.
If you're building or maintaining a website today, go for HTTP/2.
It offers significant performance enhancements and is widely supported.
However, remember that best practices for web optimization still matter.
Fast and responsive websites result from a combination of HTTP/2 and good design choices.
